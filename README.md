# SvelteKit Bulma Starter

A SvelteKit started with ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS, Sass, and Bulma

This is meant to serve as a quick starter to be used as-is with the smallest configuration possible. It also includes a sample navbar and footer for the main layout.

## Features

- PostCSS with
    - `autoprefix`
    - `cssnano` (Production only)
    - `purgecss` (Production only)
- Sass (`dart-sass`)
- Bulma (Version `0.9`)
- Typescript support
- Prettier for formatting
- ESLint for linting
